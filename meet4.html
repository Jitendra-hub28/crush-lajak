            <h3>Moments Between Us</h3>
    <p>
        Here comes our Meet Number 4 â€” again, after two months. In November, I was back on the morning shift.<br>
        A few days in, I think it was around November 5, 2024 â€” we shared a lunch moment &#128540; (no offense calling it a date ðŸ˜…).<br>
        That day, you wore full formals â€” black and gray. I sensed you were a little off that day, as I noticed you glancing around every 2â€“3 minutes. Maybe your group left you alone while they had lunch?
    </p>

    <p>
        And there I was â€” you came straight toward me and sat in front of me with those fierce eyes &#x1F620; â€” which, honestly, I like about you.<br>
        Iâ€™d never seen you that close before. It felt like a miracle. I was really happy to see you that near. I actually blushed for the first time, just looking at you.<br>
        One of my female friends saw the whole thing and couldnâ€™t stop teasing me afterward.
    </p>

    <p>
        At first, I thought it was just a coincidence â€” that you sat across from me.<br>
        But the very next day, you wore the same outfit â€” this time with a black sweatshirt and the same gray pants. It looked like you wanted to sit in front of me again... but the chairs werenâ€™t clean.<br>
        So you chose the table opposite mine instead &#128549;.
    </p>

    <p>
        After seeing you that close, this was what I felt &#128540;.

        One day my fellowmates told me that you wore a saree on Traditional Day. As I missed that chance to
        see you in saree. But, I saw that in your IG & Whatsapp DP you look OK in that color. But, many of them told 
        you look attractive. <br>

        But, I wanna see you in complete black/red saree which covers till your elbow, with small nose ring and loose hair 
        with dark eyes. I started getting into this song after I saw you in saree.
