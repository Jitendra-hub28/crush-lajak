      <h2>Meet 2 — Year End ✨</h2>

      <p>
        Here comes our meet number ✌️. It was the **year-end** of day-2. My boys and I came late for lunch.<br>
        Again, I saw you with your <s>ladies gang</s> gang — sorry for that 😅.<br>
        You wore a *pink half-sleeve top* and jeans that day.<br>
        After finishing food, I walked after you 😉.
      </p>

      <p>
        As I followed, it felt like Ram walking behind Sita in *Sita Ramam*.<br>
        I felt this music when I was behind you.<br>
        At the washbasin, you washed your hands and I stood beside you.<br>
        You saw me in the mirror and smiled. One of my friends noticed and said:<br>
        <b>“Dude! That girl just smiled at you.”</b><br>
        I was like 🥳.
