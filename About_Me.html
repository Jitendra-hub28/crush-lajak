    <h2>Jitendra #cool</h2>

    <p style="font-style: italic; margin-top: 30px;">
      By the time you read this, I might already be gone.  
      But just know — you were someone unforgettable in my little world.
    </p>

    <p>
      Hi, I’m Jitendra.<br>
      There’s nothing much to say about me just an average, introverted guy who wanders around on his own.  
      While others call their gang to hang out, I just go, Alone.  
      And I’ve gotten used to spending time with myself.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m not much of a talker, unless it’s about <strong>CRICKET</strong> or <strong>MOVIES</strong>.  
      You probably already know which team I support and the player I admire the most.  
      But what you don’t know is my madness for movies — no language barrier, no boundaries, just stories.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are only two places where I love being around people:
      <ul>
        <li>
          In theatres — where people cheer, scream, and throw paper in excitement. That vibe?  
          I rarely get to feel it anymore... but when I do, it’s magic.
        </li>
        <li>
          In cricket stadiums — where fans go crazy for their teams and favorite players.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Whenever I saw you, you were with your gang — and I never felt like stepping in.  
      Every time, I just stood there, quiet, and let the moment pass. That's why I'll
      sit at that last PC and will see you whenever you are in shift.  
      This is the first time I’ve said anything like this to anyone.  
      The first time I told someone how I felt. Ever.
    </p>

    <p>
      I wanted to say more... but the thought of making you feel  
      <mark>U-N-C-O-M-F-O-R-T-A-B-L-E</mark>  
      stopped me. I didn’t want to disturb you again.  
      So I kept it all here — where it’s quiet, like me.
    </p>

    <p>
        With Curiosity/Excitement, I just want to ask you one thing. You know that you 
        are a good looking woman and everyone desperately wants to talk to you and stares you.
        You knew that I'm one of them but mine is always different. Then, why you too stared at me.  
    </p>

    <p>
        Don't get angry. Just asking, because every time I'll sit at my desk, but you'll work in the 
        PC which is quite back to me in your team. And, I thought it's an accidental. But, in remaining days 
        you choose to pick the PC where I sit. I.E.., you wantedly want me to see you like something else..&#128521;
    </p>

    <p>
        Last but not least. <a href="image.html">click here</a> I'm not much a melody lover. I'll add some of my BGM's which I love the most.
        If you feel my music is not much impressed I don't even no what to do. Please adjust. Listen to my
        blasts & enjoy.
    </p>

    <p style="background-color: chocolate; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif; font-style: italic; font-weight: 100;">
       Mera Dil (you), where you live in "CITY OF DREAMS" & I live in "CITY OF DESTINATION." Where I thought I'll find my dream
       in my destination, but now I got to know that "DREAM & DESTINATION have different paths & goals."
